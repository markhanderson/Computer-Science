# Consider the statement: L = {'1':1, '2':2, '3':3}. Which is correct?
# L is a list
# L is immutable
# L contains 6 elements
# L has integer keys
# L maps strings to integers [X]

# Assume a break statement is executed inside a loop and that the loop 
# is inside a function. Which of the following is correct?
# The program might immediately terminate.
# The function might immediately terminate.
# The loop will always immediately terminate.

# Assume the statement s[1024] = 3 does not produce an error message. 
# This implies:
# type(s) can be str
# type(s) can be tuple
# type(s) can be list [X]
# All of the above

# Consider the code:
